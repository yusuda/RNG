# Random Number Generator ver.1.0

## General Information

This script is made for my own training of tkinter / GUI
applications. This application is nothing but generating a random
number (within positive integers) according to the maximam number
input by user.

## Licences and responsibilities

The author claim nothing about the copyright on the application. You
can edit and redistribute absolutely freely. The original author takes
no charges about troubles on your system or any place triggered by the
original / edited versions.

## Usage

Simply execute on your shell

<code>python /path/to/script/randdisp.py</code>

and then put the number for specifing the maximam number of the range
of random numbers.

On starting there are some huge chinese charactors on the window. They
mean "not specified." After you put the number and push "next," the
charactors will dissapear and the number will show up.

Note that this script has to be executed on Python 3.x series. Your
system is required to enable the tkinter module other than the minimum
construction.
